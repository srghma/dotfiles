# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# This file is part of ranger, the console file manager.
# This configuration file is licensed under the same terms as ranger.
# ===================================================================
#
# NOTE: If you copied this file to ~/.config/ranger/commands_full.py,
# then it will NOT be loaded by ranger, and only serve as a reference.
#
# ===================================================================
# This file contains ranger's commands.
# It's all in python; lines beginning with # are comments.
#
# Note that additional commands are automatically generated from the methods
# of the class ranger.core.actions.Actions.
#
# You can customize commands in the file ~/.config/ranger/commands.py.
# It has the same syntax as this file.  In fact, you can just copy this
# file there with `ranger --copy-config=commands' and make your modifications.
# But make sure you update your configs when you update ranger.
#
# ===================================================================
# Every class defined here which is a subclass of `Command' will be used as a
# command in ranger.  Several methods are defined to interface with ranger:
#   execute():   called when the command is executed.
#   cancel():    called when closing the console.
#   tab(tabnum): called when <TAB> is pressed.
#   quick():     called after each keypress.
#
# tab() argument tabnum is 1 for <TAB> and -1 for <S-TAB> by default
#
# The return values for tab() can be either:
#   None: There is no tab completion
#   A string: Change the console to this string
#   A list/tuple/generator: cycle through every item in it
#
# The return value for quick() can be:
#   False: Nothing happens
#   True: Execute the command afterwards
#
# The return value for execute() and cancel() doesn't matter.
#
# ===================================================================
# Commands have certain attributes and methods that facilitate parsing of
# the arguments:
#
# self.line: The whole line that was written in the console.
# self.args: A list of all (space-separated) arguments to the command.
# self.quantifier: If this command was mapped to the key "X" and
#      the user pressed 6X, self.quantifier will be 6.
# self.arg(n): The n-th argument, or an empty string if it doesn't exist.
# self.rest(n): The n-th argument plus everything that followed.  For example,
#      if the command was "search foo bar a b c", rest(2) will be "bar a b c"
# self.start(n): Anything before the n-th argument.  For example, if the
#      command was "search foo bar a b c", start(2) will be "search foo"
#
# ===================================================================
# And this is a little reference for common ranger functions and objects:
#
# self.fm: A reference to the "fm" object which contains most information
#      about ranger.
# self.fm.notify(string): Print the given string on the screen.
# self.fm.notify(string, bad=True): Print the given string in RED.
# self.fm.reload_cwd(): Reload the current working directory.
# self.fm.thisdir: The current working directory. (A File object.)
# self.fm.thisfile: The current file. (A File object too.)
# self.fm.thistab.get_selection(): A list of all selected files.
# self.fm.execute_console(string): Execute the string as a ranger command.
# self.fm.open_console(string): Open the console with the given string
#      already typed in for you.
# self.fm.move(direction): Moves the cursor in the given direction, which
#      can be something like down=3, up=5, right=1, left=1, to=6, ...
#
# File objects (for example self.fm.thisfile) have these useful attributes and
# methods:
#
# tfile.path: The path to the file.
# tfile.basename: The base name only.
# tfile.load_content(): Force a loading of the directories content (which
#      obviously works with directories only)
# tfile.is_directory: True/False depending on whether it's a directory.
#
# For advanced commands it is unavoidable to dive a bit into the source code
# of ranger.
